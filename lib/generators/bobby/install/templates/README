Some setup you must do manually:

  1. add a filter to your ApplicationController

		before_filter :access_authorized?
		
	 or add the filter to select controllers
	
	 if controllers follows particular patterns like the Presenter Pattern
	 add the table(s) as arguments to the filter
	
		before_filter :access_authorized? :posts, :comments

  2. add a default_scope to your models

		default_scope :instances_authorized

  3. build access control structures using the Role, Permission and GroupUser views,
 	 like

		/roles
		/permissions
		/group_users
